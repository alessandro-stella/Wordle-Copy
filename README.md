<h3>:memo: - Rules of the game</h3>
<h4>The object of the game is to guess the mysterious word in as few attempts as possible</h4>
Starting with a random word, once its validity has been confirmed, the results of the entry will be given by coloring the letters of the word entered
<ul>
<li>
    If the letter turns gray, it means that it is not present in the word to guess
</li>
<li>
    If the letter turns yellow, it means that it is present in the word to be guessed, but not in the current position
</li>
<li>
    If the letter turns green, it means that the entered letter is present in that position
</li>
</ul>

From then on, with the results of the words entered previously, you will have to try to get close and guess the mysterious word before finishing the attempts available

<h4> Good luck and have fun!</h4>
